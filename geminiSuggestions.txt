  Suggested File Structure for Improved Manageability
Here's a proposed file structure that would improve the manageability of your project:

buildpreset/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py
├── mutate.py
├── utils.py
├── blocks/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cab.py
│   ├── split.py
│   ├── amp.py
│   ├── ... (other block types)
├── templates/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── template1.json
│   ├── template2.json
│   ├── ... (other templates)
├── output/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── preset1.hlx
│   ├── preset2.hlx
│   ├── ... (generated presets)
Explanation:

init.py files in each subfolder serve as entry points and can be used to import specific functions or classes from that module.
main.py remains the main entry point for the script, handling command-line arguments and orchestrating the overall process.
mutate.py contains functions related to mutating preset parameters and block configurations.
utils.py houses utility functions used throughout the project, such as loading JSON files, printing messages, etc.
blocks/ folder contains subfolders for different block types (e.g., cab, split, amp). Each subfolder can have its own Python file (e.g., cab.py) to encapsulate logic specific to that block type.
templates/ folder stores the JSON template files used to generate presets.
output/ folder stores the generated preset files.
Benefits:

Modularization: Breaking down the code into smaller, focused modules improves readability, maintainability, and reusability.
Organization: Grouping related files together makes it easier to navigate and understand the project structure.
Separation of Concerns: Different modules can handle specific tasks, making it easier to identify and modify individual parts of the code.
Scalability: As the project grows, adding new features or block types becomes more manageable with a well-defined structure.
Additional Considerations:

You can further subdivide modules based on functionality or complexity.
Consider using a package manager like pip to manage dependencies and simplify installation.
Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual modules and functions.
By adopting this file structure, you'll create a more organized, maintainable, and scalable project that's easier to understand and modify in the future.
