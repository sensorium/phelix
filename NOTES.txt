find a minimal preset template which I can add blocks to
make a bundle with one block in each preset
save the bundle as seperate presets
process the presets to extract all blocks
(is there a way to do it without having to snapshot every control?)


the preset template needs any splits to have snapshot params for them to be able to be replaced
controller 18 means midi cc

what's the diff between these:
data tone controller dsp...blocks
  lists the params that have been set for snapshots or other controllers
data tone dsp .. blocks
  has all the parameters for each block and their defaults before snapshots or other controllers change them
data tone snapshot# controllers dsp.. blocks
  has the values for each snapshot controlled param
